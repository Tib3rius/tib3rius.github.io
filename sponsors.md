# Sponsor Tib3rius!

Hi, I'm Tib3rius, a cybersecurity content creator with a highly engaged audience across YouTube, Twitter/X, and LinkedIn. I create educational, entertaining, and insightful content for cybersecurity professionals around the world. My audience includes pentesters, bug bounty hunters, software developers, CISOs, etc.

With a strong community of security-minded followers and a reputation for cutting through the noise, I offer authentic and effective sponsorship opportunities that resonate with the cybersecurity crowd.
